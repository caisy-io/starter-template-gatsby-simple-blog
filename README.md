### We are using

- Gatsby as server and server side rendering framework
- tailwindcss for styling
- @caisy/rich-text-react-renderer to render the caisy richtexts in Gatsby
- graphql and graphql-request to fetch data from caisy
- During development we generate code using `@graphql-codegen/cli and plugins` you will need to run `yarn gen` to generate the types
